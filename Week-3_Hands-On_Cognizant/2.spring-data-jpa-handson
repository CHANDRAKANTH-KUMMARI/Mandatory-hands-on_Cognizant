Difference between JPA, Hibernate and Spring Data JPA

1.JPA (Java Persistence API):
JPA is just a set of rules (an interface).
It defines how Java objects should be saved into a database.
It doesn't do anything by itself — it's like a contract or a guide.
You need some tool or library to implement JPA, like Hibernate.

Hibernate:
Hibernate is a tool (framework) that follows JPA rules.
It gives you the actual code to connect Java classes to the database.
You write less SQL — Hibernate does it behind the scenes.
It implements JPA, but also adds extra features (like caching, lazy loading).

Spring Data JPA:
Spring Data JPA is a layer built on top of JPA and Hibernate.
It makes your life even easier — no need to write any SQL or even methods.
Just create an interface (like BookRepository) and Spring handles everything.
It uses Hibernate behind the scenes (by default).
