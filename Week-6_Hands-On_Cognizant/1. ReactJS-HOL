Estimated time to complete this lab: 30 minutes.
Create a new React Application with the name “myfirstreact”, Run the application to print “welcome to the first session of React” as heading of that page.
1.	To create a new React app, Install Nodejs and Npm from the following link:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2.	Install Create-react-app by running the following command in the command prompt:
3.	To create a React Application with the name of “myfirstreact”, type the following command:
4.	Once the App is created, navigate into the folder of myfirstreact by typing the following command:
5.	Open the folder of myfirstreact in Visual Studio Code
6.	Open the App.js file in Src Folder of myfirstreact
7.	Remove the current content of “App.js”
8.	Replace it with the following:
9.	Run the following command to execute the React application:
10	Open a new browser window and type “localhost:3000” in the address bar


Answer:

1.Define SPA and its benefits
SPA means Single Page Application. It loads only one web page and updates content dynamically without refreshing the whole page.
Benefits:
Fast page loading
Smooth user experience
Uses less server bandwidth
Better for creating dynamic and interactive apps

2.Define React and identify its working
React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces. It helps in creating web apps using small pieces called components.
How it works:
React uses a virtual DOM. When you make changes, React updates only the changed parts, not the whole page. This makes the app faster and more efficient.

3.Identify the differences between SPA and MPA
SPA means Single Page Application. MPA means Multi Page Application.
SPA:
Loads one page and updates parts dynamically
Faster and smoother
Good for dynamic apps
MPA:
Loads a new page on each request
Slower compared to SPA
Better for large websites and SEO

4.Explain Pros and Cons of Single Page Application
Pros:
Fast performance
No full page reload
Good user experience
Cons:
SEO is harder
Initial load time can be more
Can be complex to manage

5.Explain about React
React is a tool for building web interfaces. It is created by Facebook. It uses components, virtual DOM, and works well for fast and modern web apps. Developers use React to build both small and large applications easily.

6.Define virtual DOM
Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real browser DOM. React uses it to find the changes and then updates only those parts in the real DOM. This improves speed and performance.

7.Explain Features of React
Component-based structure
Uses JSX to write HTML in JavaScript
Fast performance using virtual DOM
One-way data flow
Easy to reuse code
Large community and tool support

npm install -g create-react-app
npx create-react-app myfirstreact
cd myfirstreact
code .
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the first session of React</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
npm start
http://localhost:3000
